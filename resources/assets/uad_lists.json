When an app attempts to resolve the value of a resource in the target package, the value of the overlay resource the target resource is mapped to is returned instead.\nThe CellBroadcastService service supports CellBroadcast SMS decoding, geofencing for wireless emergency alert (WEA) 3.0, message duplication checks, and broadcasting messages to apps. It's a one-to-many geotargeted and geofenced messaging service designed to deliver messages to multiple mobile phone users, in a defined area, at the same time. The service is defined by the [ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/about) GSM committee, [3GPP](https://www.3gpp.org/about-3gpp), and is a part of the telecommunication standards.\nhttps://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/rros\nhttps://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/modular-system/cellbroadcast",
